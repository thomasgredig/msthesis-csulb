## Samples

Thin films of FePc deposited onto silicon substrates are often used because of their ability to form quasi one-dimensional magnetic iron chains Previously, forty thermally evaporated samples were prepared onto various types of silicon substrates and gold substrates at room temperature (RT), 60°C, 80°C, 100°C, 140°C, 160°C, 180°C, 200°C, 220°C, and 230°C. The varying silicon orientation wafers and gold wafers were scribed with a diamond tip pen into 4 x 10 mm and 10 x 10 mm sample dimensions. The series was created in 2010 by Tarun Sharma and the process is described based on their work.
