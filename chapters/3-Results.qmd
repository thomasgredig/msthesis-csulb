title: "Results and Analysis"
---

Section with results and analysis. We use embedded R code to display the following image, see @fig-afm. Quarto uses the R compiler to render the image and convert the qmd file into a markdown code that can be translated into HTML or PDF via pandoc.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Sample image from the nanoAFMr package that
#|    helps visualize atomic force microscopy images.
#| fig-scap: AFM sample image from nanoAFMr package.
#| label: fig-afm

library(nanoAFMr)
fname = AFM.getSampleImages('tiff')
a = AFM.import(fname)
plot(a, quiet=TRUE)
```

The labels of figures should start with `fig-`, whereas tables start with `tbl-` and sections with `sec-`.
