## CSULB M.S. Thesis Template

This is an unofficial Quarto `msthesis-csulb` template for the California State University Long Beach (CSULB) M.S. thesis created by Thomas Gredig. This template is based on the Quarto markdown language, which provides simplicity, readability, transparency, and embedded computation.

-   Creates PDF format for thesis submission
-   Creates HTML format
-   Reproducible figures with embedded code

## Installation

Install the [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org), then install the template from the terminal:

``` bash
quarto use template thomasgredig/msthesis-csulb
```

You are prompted to create a new subfolder with the M.S. thesis template files. You should also have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Julia](https://julialang.org/) installed, use `quarto check` to verify. Next, open the project with [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (or text editor or [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

Render both HTML and msthesis-csulb PDF formats. If both file formats render, you can continue and start with your thesis.
